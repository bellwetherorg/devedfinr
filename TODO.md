  # TODO.md
  
  1. DESCRIPTION file issues:
    - Remove placeholder author ("Jane Doe") and add real author information
    - Update email to real maintainer email
    - Add proper package description (current one is good but ensure it's accurate)
    - Add URL field pointing to package repository
    - Add BugReports field for issue tracking
  2. Documentation gaps:
    - Internal functions (cache_path, cache_file, is_cache_current) are documented but
  marked as @keywords internal - either remove their .Rd files or properly export them
    - Missing package-level documentation (add devedfinr-package.R)
    - Update list_variables() to return actual column names from the dataset (currently has
   placeholders)
  3. License file:
    - Ensure LICENSE file contains proper MIT license text
    - LICENSE.md should contain full license terms

  Important Issues

  4. Testing:
    - No test files found - add comprehensive tests using testthat
    - Test all exported functions with various inputs
    - Test error conditions and edge cases
  5. Data validation:
    - The package downloads a 30MB+ RDS file - consider data size implications
    - Add data validation after downloading to ensure integrity
    - Document expected data structure
  6. README improvements:
    - Update GitHub username in installation instructions
    - Add badges (CRAN status, R-CMD-check, coverage)
    - Add more comprehensive examples
    - Add citation information

  Good Practices

  7. Code quality:
    - Add input validation for all function parameters
    - Consider adding progress bars for long downloads
    - Add more informative error messages
  8. Documentation enhancements:
    - Add vignettes to demonstrate package usage
    - Document data sources more thoroughly
    - Add examples showing integration with tidyverse
  9. Package infrastructure:
    - Add .github/ folder with CI/CD workflows
    - Add NEWS.md file
    - Add cran-comments.md for submission notes
    - Add .Rbuildignore entries for non-package files
  10. CRAN policies:
    - Ensure package doesn't write to user's home directory without permission
    - Add option to set custom cache directory
    - Respect user's download settings
  ⎿  ☒ Examine package structure and key files
     ☒ Check DESCRIPTION file for CRAN requirements
     ☒ Review R code files for issues
     ☒ Check documentation completeness
     ☒ Create comprehensive CRAN submission punch list
